## 🚀 Introduction

This project aims to create a **completely anonymous** P2P network leveraging **Tor**, ensuring every participant remains anonymous, while the system is decentralized with no central authority.

### **Key Technologies:**
- **Tor**: Anonymity via the Tor network.
- **Monero**: For the anonymous reward system.

---

## 🌟 Main Features

- **Anonymous Nodes**: Every node operates as a **Tor hidden service** to ensure anonymity.
- **Complete Autonomy**: Nodes autonomously join the network without predefined configurations.
- **Next Secure Rewards**: Users are rewarded in **Monero** for maintaining the network.
- **Decentralized Management**: There are no single points of failure. The network is fully distributed.

However, the issues encountered with the network layer were more complex as explained in the Transport Layer Section and some goals could not be achieved with certainty. As a result, trade-offs were made to ensure the project's completion within the constraints by deciding to build a simple yet effective network management layer to allow nodes to communicate. Although this approach was time-consuming and not much time was spent on expanding the business logic, I believe that the overall goal of getting the idea across that an innovative and anonymous ecosystem is necessary was more crucial."]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"What is needed in this age is a globally recognized and widely used system that ensures privacy and anonymity, while maintaining a high level of decentralization and censorship resistance.

Moreover, it allows thinking beyond the simple reward for task execution or processing. In particular, new types of nodes, designed solely to support the network, could be introduced.

To optimize task routing, a more efficient routing mechanism could be implemented, possibly leveraging new metrics provided by the Tor network or by supporters.

In this case, a task classification mechanism could be introduced to weigh tasks based on their complexity and importance, introducing the concept of task priority linked also to the reward system.

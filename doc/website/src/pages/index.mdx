## Interacting with the system

### Web interfaces

- **Revue Web Interface**: The interface through which you can interact with the
  system. The default credentials for the login are `user` and `user` (editable
  in [auth/db/auth-init.js](auth/db/auth-init.js)
  file).
    - [https://frontend.localhost](https://frontend.localhost) or [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) if
      running with Docker Compose
    - [https://revue-frontend](https://revue-frontend) if running with Kubernetes
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik dashboard
    - [https://localhost:8081](https://localhost:8081) if running with Docker Compose
    - [https://revue-traefik/dashboard/#/](https://revue-traefik/dashboard/#/) if running with Kubernetes
- **Kafka UI**: The interface to monitor the Kafka topics, messages and
  consumers
    - [https://localhost:8082](https://localhost:8082) if running with Docker Compose
    - [https://revue-kafka-ui](https://revue-kafka-ui) if running with Kubernetes,

#### On Kubernetes environment

- **Prometheus and Grafana**: The interfaces to monitor the system
    - Prometheus Server dashboard: accessible at [https://revue-prometheus](https://192.168.5.206:9090)
    - Grafana dashboard: accessible at [https://revue-grafana](https://revue-grafana)
        - Credentials:
            - Username: _admin_
            - Password: Get the password by
              running `kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo`
        - Accessing to the dashboard clicking on _Dashboards_ (there are some pre-configured dashboards)

Note that kubernetes IPs depend on your cluster's network-specific configuration.
Edit configuration files in [kubernetes/specifications/metallb/](kubernetes/specifications/metallb/) folder
to adhere to your case.
### Monitoring with devices (WoT)

Go to the [revue-sample-thing](https://github.com/revue-org/revue-sample-thing) repository and follow the instructions
in the README to set up your own WoT device.
Note that if you are running the system with Docker Compose, a sample containerised device is already deployed.
Once the device is up and running, you can add it to the system through the Revue Web Interface.

- Go to [Revue Web Interface](#web-interfaces) and log in
- Go to the _Devices_ section
- Click on the _Add Device_ button
- Fill in the form with the device URI
    - `<container-name>:<exposed-port>` if revue is running with Docker Compose
        - The already deployed sample device is exposed at `revue-thing:6000`
    - Test the connection.
    - If the connection is successful, it will automatically retrieve the device's capabilities.
      Eventually, give a description and click _Ok_ to add the device to the system.
- Monitor the device data through the various sections depending on the device capabilities.

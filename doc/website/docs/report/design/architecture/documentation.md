# Architecture

The system consists of nodes with various components that interact to deliver the described functionalities. The design follows **Clean Architecture** principles [Martin, 2017], promoting independence from frameworks and libraries. This methodology separates the system into layers, each responsible for specific tasks, ensuring modularity and flexibility.

This architecture emphasizes the separation of concerns and follows the *Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)* [Martin, 1996], facilitating a robust and maintainable system design.

## Components

Nodes in the system have different components based on their roles. Provider and consumer nodes share some components but differ in responsibilities.

### Provider Node Components

Provider nodes have three key services: **Discovery Service**, **Metric Service**, and **Task Service**. These services are managed by the **Node Service**, which coordinates with them to perform tasks. Connectors include the **Event Broker**, **Repository Connector** (for IPFS storage), and **REST API** for internal monitoring.

### Consumer Node Components

Consumer nodes have a simpler structure, omitting the **Discovery Service** and **Metric Service**, as they are not needed. The **Node Service** interacts with the network using the **Task Service** to handle task submissions and result retrieval, and the **Event Broker** facilitates network interactions.

### Event Broker

The Event Broker in a decentralized system represents a challenging component. Gossip-based publish-subscribe is the decentralized messaging paradigm used, which leverages gossip protocols for disseminating events across a network [Vyzovitis, 2020]. Unlike traditional broker-based pub-sub systems, where a central broker manages subscriptions and message delivery, gossip-based pub-sub distributes messages in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) fashion. Nodes periodically exchange information with a subset of their peers, ensuring that events propagate throughout the network in an eventually consistent manner. This approach enhances fault tolerance, scalability, and resilience against failures, making it well-suited for large-scale distributed systems. However, redundant message transmission combined with high-latency networks like Tor introduces challenges compared to structured pub-sub models.

## Other Considered Alternatives

While the **Event-Driven Model** was chosen for the system, other alternatives, particularly the **Actor Model**, were evaluated. The Actor Model aligns well with the systemâ€™s requirements but was considered complex and had a steep learning curve, which might hinder rapid prototyping and adoption by the developer community. Additionally, the **Event-Driven Model** was preferred due to its **Loose Coupling** and **Flexibility**, whereas the Actor Model tends to be **Tightly Coupled**, requiring direct communication between actors and introducing dependencies that reduce the system's scalability.

From an **ecosystem perspective**, the **Event-Driven Model** was preferred due to the following key advantages:

1. **Loose Coupling & Flexibility**: Components remain independent, making modifications and integrations easier.
2. **Stateless and Scalable by Design**: Enables effortless scaling.
3. **Lower Learning Curve**: More accessible to developers familiar with standard messaging protocols.
4. **Better for Asynchronous Workflows**: Naturally integrates with async/await patterns and reactive programming.

The **Actor Model** remains a powerful alternative, offering fault tolerance and resilient state management.

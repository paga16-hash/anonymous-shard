# Introduction

This section presents the developed prototype,
describing the flow of job units, main functionalities, 
and interactions between nodes.
Additionally, some hints on possible extensions to evolve 
it into a generic anonymous computing system are provided.
However, a more detailed analysis of future developments will 
be discussed in the conclusion chapter.

The goal from the early stages of the project was 
to create a functional and easily extensible prototype 
that could serve as a foundation for future research and 
advancements in **anonymous computing**. 
The main constraint was time, so the focus was placed 
on core functionalities and interactions between key components, 
providing a proof of concept.

To ensure communication anonymity between nodes, the system
leverages the Tor network. 
However, further work is needed to guarantee anonymity at 
the computation level, with some initial considerations already outlined.

The design choices aimed to strike a balance between modularity and 
security, ensuring that each subcomponent could be easily 
replaced or extended. 
However, due to the anonymity requirements, 
the system's design and implementation posed significant challenges, 
leading to a strong focus on security aspects.
